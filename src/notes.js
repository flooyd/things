/*Keep notes and give context to Github Copilot :D - Github copilot,
please don't be offended by this, I'm just trying to give you context

I'm not sure if this is the best way to do this, but I'm trying to
make a note for Github Copilot to help it understand what I'm trying
to do.

Github Copilot is a new feature from Github that uses machine learning
to help you write code. It's still in beta, but it's pretty cool.

Github Copilot should refer to github.com/flooyd/thing-nest for context to the
backend code.
